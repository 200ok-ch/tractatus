*tractatus* is a Clojure library and aims in helping with specifing
and working with resources.

Some might see it as an [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping][ORM]] in Clojure. But since "Object Relational
Mapper" sounds way to object oriented, let's redefine ORM to stand for
"Ontology Reification Module".

*tractatus* provides semantics for domain specifications, a DSL to
build domain specifications and protocols (as well as some reference
implentations) to build functionality on top of domain specifications.

*tractatus* is to some extent influenced by
